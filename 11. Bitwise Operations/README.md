01. Binary Digits Count Solution

You are given a positive integer number and one binary digit B (0 or 1). Your task is to write a program that finds the number of binary digits (B) in given integer.
02. Bit at Position 1 Solution

Write a program that prints the bit at position 1 of given integer. We use the standard counting: from right to left, starting from 0.
03. P-th Bit Solution

Write a program that prints the bit at position p of given integer. We use the standard counting: from right to left, starting from 0.
04. Bit Destroyer Solution

Write a program that sets the bit at position p to 0. Print the resulting integer.
05. * Odd Times Solution

You are given an array of positive integers in a single line, separated by a space (' '). All numbers occur even number of times except one number which occurs odd number of times. Find it, using only bitwise operations.
06. * Tri-bit Switch Solution

Write a program that inverts the 3 bits from position p to the left with their XOR opposites (e.g. 111 -> 000, 101 -> 010) in 32-bit number. Print the resulting integer on the console.
